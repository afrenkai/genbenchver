        "epilogue": "The lifespan of mythical creatures is based on various mythological sources and interpretations. Immortal creatures, such as Satyrs, Gorgons, and Djinn, live forever unless killed. Some creatures, like the Basilisk, have short lifespans, lasting only minutes to hours. Others, like Mermaids and Harpies, live for decades. Unicorns and Dragons are said to live for thousands of years. Centaurs, Cyclops, and Griffins have lifespans similar to humans, living for centuries. The Phoenix is unique, as it is reborn through self-immolation, making its lifespan effectively immortal. The Wendigo's lifespan is tied to its existence, which is sustained by cannibalism, making it indefinite. The Hydra is also considered immortal due to its ability to regenerate lost heads. The Lifespan of the Chimera is unknown, as it is not specified in most mythological accounts.",
