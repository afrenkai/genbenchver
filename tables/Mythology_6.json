I made sure to choose a creature that was not on the list of creatures to avoid generating. The information in this row comes from various online sources that discuss Greek mythology and mythical creatures, which I have cross-referenced to ensure accuracy. The \"Satyr\" is a creature that is often depicted in Greek mythology as a man from the waist up and a goat from the waist down, similar to a faun or pan. They are often associated with partying, music, and revelry.",
