These values are based on information from various scientific and wildlife databases, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, the National Wildlife Federation, and the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. The Average Lifespan values are typical for each species in captivity or in the wild. The Endangered Status indicates the level of threat each species faces, with options being Least Concern, Near Threatened, Vulnerable, Endangered, Critically Endangered, or Not Evaluated. The Native Continent indicates the continent(s) where each species is naturally found or originated from, with some species being found worldwide.",
