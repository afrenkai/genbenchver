For this table, I have taken the average of the maximum temperatures to get the average maximum temperature and the average of the minimum temperatures to get the average minimum temperature. I then listed them as the Average Maximum and Minimum temperatures for the entire year.\n\nThe annual precipitation for Brisbane and Canberra are given as average monthly rainfall. To get the annual precipitation, I added up all the average monthly rainfall values and listed it as the Annual Precipitation for the entire year.\n\nThe Humidity for both cities is rated as Moderate or Humid based on the scale found here: <https://weather-and-climate.com/humidity-scale>\n\nThe Sun for both cities is the average number of hours of sunshine per day, based on the data from the following sources:\nBrisbane: <https://weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-sunshine-duration-brisbane>\nCanberra: <https://weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-sunshine-duration-canberra>",
