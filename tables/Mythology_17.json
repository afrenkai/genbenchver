I selected creatures that have distinct characteristics and are well-known in mythology and folklore.\n\nHarpy: I chose the Harpy based on its unique feature of having a woman's face and a foul temper, which is distinct from other mythical creatures. Harpies are often depicted as having the bodies of birds, particularly vultures or screech owls. They originate from Greek mythology.\n\nMermaid: Mermaids are popular mythical creatures with a rich history in maritime folklore. They are depicted as having the upper body of a female human and the tail of a fish. Mermaids are often associated with sirens, finfolk, and mermen. The origin of mermaids can be traced back to various cultures, including Greek, Roman, and Norse mythology, as well as various folktales and legends from around the world.",
