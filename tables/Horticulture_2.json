The information provided is general guidance and may vary depending on specific growing conditions.\n\nSweet Basil is a popular herb grown during the summer months. It prefers well-drained soil and moist conditions, with a temperature range of 70-80\u00b0F and full sun exposure. Pinch back the plant to encourage bushiness and use a balanced fertilizer. Common pests include aphids and Fusarium Wilt.\n\nBroccoli is a cool-season vegetable, typically planted in spring. It requires loamy soil and moderate watering, with a temperature range of 60-70\u00b0F and full sun exposure. Do not cut the florets to encourage further growth. Use a nitrogen-rich fertilizer and be aware of pests such as Cabbage Worms and Downy Mildew.\n\nCabbage is a cool-season vegetable, typically planted in the fall. It can have purple varieties and requires loamy soil and moderate watering, with a temperature range of 60-70\u00b0F and full sun exposure. Do not cut the core to encourage further growth. Use a nitrogen-rich fertilizer and be aware of pests such as Imported Cabbageworm and Black Rot.",
