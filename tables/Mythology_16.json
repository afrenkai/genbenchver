        "epilogue": "The lifespan of mythical creatures is not always explicitly stated in mythology and folklore, so in many cases, the values for this attribute are based on educated guesses or assumptions. For example, immortal creatures such as Pegasus, Cerberus, and Nymphs are assumed to be immortal because they are often depicted as such in mythology. Similarly, creatures such as the Hydra and Gorgon are also considered immortal because they have the ability to regenerate or be reborn. For creatures such as the Chimera, Minotaur, and Cyclops, their lifespans are unknown because they are not explicitly stated in Greek mythology. Unicorns and Centaurs are assumed to have longer lifespans because they are often depicted as wise and powerful creatures in various mythologies and stories. The lifespan of the Basilisk is based on its deadly abilities and the fact that it can cause death with its gaze or a single touch. The lifespan of the Mermaid is unknown because it can vary greatly depending on the specific mythology or story. The lifespan of the Dragon is also variable because it can vary greatly depending on the specific dragon in mythology or folklore.",
