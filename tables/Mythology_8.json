They are often depicted as being lustful and rowdy, accompanying Dionysus, the god of wine, in his revelries. Satyrs are also associated with music and dance, often seen playing pipes or other instruments.\n\nSource: Encyclopedia Britannica (<https://www.britannica.com/topic/satyr-Greek-mythology>) /",
