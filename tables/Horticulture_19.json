        "epilogue": "Bluecrop is a variety of blueberry that is known to produce fruit in the spring, summer, and fall seasons. The berries are blue in color. Blueberries prefer moist, acidic soil and require medium water intake. They thrive in temperatures between 60-70\u00b0F and full sun exposure. Blueberries require moderate pruning and acidic fertilizer. The main pest for blueberries are birds.\n\nSources:\n1. \"Bluecrop.\" Missouri Botanical Garden, www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/PlantFinder/PlantFinderDetails.aspx?kempercode=b630.\n2. \"Blueberry, Highbush.\" Alabama Cooperative Extension System, www.aces.edu/pubs/docs/A/ANR-1367/ANR-1367.pdf.\n3. \"How to Grow Blueberries.\" The Spruce, www.thespruce.com/how-to-grow-blueberries-2132423.",
