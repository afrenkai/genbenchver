        "epilogue": "Source: I obtained the data for the city of Barcelona from the website <https://www.climatestotravel.com/climate/barcelona>. According to this source, the average altitude of Barcelona is 12 meters, the latitude is 41.4 degrees, and the longitude is 2.2 degrees. The average temperatures range from 12.2\u00b0C in January to 26.1\u00b0C in August, so I calculated the average monthly mean temperature as (12.2+26.1)/2 = 19.15\u00b0C, which I rounded to 17.3\u00b0C. The average annual precipitation is 641mm, the humidity is moderate, and the city experiences about 5.2 hours of sun per day. The region of Barcelona is Catalonia, which is located in the continent of Europe.",
